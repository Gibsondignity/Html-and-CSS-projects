        <h3>About Python</h3>
        <p>
            Python is an interpreted, object oriented, widely used general-purpose and a high-level programming language. It was originally designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and afterwards developed by the Python Software Foundation. 
            It was created primarily to emphasize the readability of code, and its syntax enables programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.
        </p><br>
    
        <h3>Why Python?</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Python</b> is an all purpose interpreted languuage which has a claer and readable syntax. It is recommended for beginners because
            its syntax is very simple and easy to read. Python is a beginner friendly as proposed by many developers. You can get your application up and running in just a few lines of codes as compared to the other programmig languages.

            <p><b>Python</b> is a <strong>multi-paradigm programming language</strong>, <strong>Object-oriented programming</strong>, and <strong>structured programming</strong> are fully supported, and many of its features support <strong>functional programming</strong> and <strong>aspect-oriented programming</strong>.</p>
        </p>

                  <p>
                    A programming paradigm is the concept by which the methodology of a programming language adheres to. Paradigms are important because they define a programming language and how it works. 
                    A great way to think about a paradigm is as a set of ideas that a programming language can use to perform tasks in terms of machine-code at a much higher level.
                    In other words, a programming paradigm is a style of programming based on a particular model of computation

                      <p>
                        Object-oriented programming is based on organizing code through objects which encapsulate both data and behaviour (methods or functions).
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        A structured programming is a logical programming method that facilitates the creation of programs with readable code and reusable components . In Python a structured programming is written with only the three constructions sequence, decision (if..elif..else statements), and repetition (while or for statements). 
                        <br><i><b>NB:</b></i> The body of a Python if, elif, while, or for statement is indicated by indenting four spaces.  
                        Python does not use end statements. <br>

                      <p>
                        Python's functionality of using a single code across different platforms makes developers capable of tackling any query related to data. 
                        Since Big Data is a highly emerging component, new platforms have to be compatible with Hadoop, Storm, NoSQL. 
                        Python's class-apart features include automatic management of memory and dynamic system. 
                        It makes Python convenient and significant in developing complex applications.               
                        <br>
                        Different numeric and scientific applications are more comfortable to develop with Python's data analytic and visualizing features. 
                        Its data analytics features enable developing innovative Big Data solutions. Plus, its libraries and programming interfaces, 
                        equipped with data visualization, helps developers in visualizing and presenting data efficiently and attractively. 
                        Python also simplifies accomplishing tasks that require artificial intelligence and NLP.

                      <p>
                        Web development with Python assists developers in building interactive user interfaces. 
                        Moreover, its reliable and intuitive nature makes it a preferred choice for introducing machine learning too. 
                        The current era is opening up many possibilities with the Internet of Things. And Python brings excellence in exchanging
                        and communicating data. Python's Raspberry Pi is a great example that enables the development of small devices like radios and cameras. 
                        Python helps in facilitating a smoother development process that is easier to maintain, flexible, and scalable in the future.
