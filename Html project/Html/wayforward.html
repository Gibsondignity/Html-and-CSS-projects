        <h1>Way Forward</h1>

        <p>First of all, thank you for following this course to the end. I believe you have 
            gotten something that will help you in your Python journey?  This brings us to the end of this Python Beginner course.
            <br><br>
            I want to use this opportunity to give directives on where and how to start creating Web, Cell Phone  and Desktop Apps.  

        </p>

        <h3>Web Apps</h3>
        <p>
            Python is a beautiful language. It’s easy to learn and fun, and its syntax (the rules) is clear and concise. 
            Python is a popular choice for beginners, yet still powerful enough to back some of the world’s most popular 
            products and applications from companies like NASA, Google, IBM, Cisco, Microsoft, Industrial Light & Magic among others.
            <br><br>
            One area where Python shines is web development. Python offers many frameworks from which to choose from including bottle.py, Flask, CherryPy, Pyramid, Django and web2py. 
            These frameworks have been used to power some of the world’s most popular sites such as Spotify, Mozilla, Reddit, the Washington Post and Yelp. The tutorials and articles in 
            this section cover techniques used in the development of Python Web applications and focus on how to program real-world solutions to problems that ordinary people actually want to solve.

            <br><a href="https://realpython.com/bonus/discover-flask-video-tutorial/">Free Python Flask Course</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Desktop Apps</h3>
        <p>
            Can you create a desktop application using Python? The answer is a big Yes, you can. 

            There are several libraries in Python, but Tkinter is one of the easiest one among them. So, I recommend you use Tkinter for your Desktop Apps
            <br><br>
            To create a desktop application, you need to learn the basics of Python, object-oriented programming, and the fundamentals of the Tkinter library. 
            Tkinter is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) library of Python, which can help you create desktop apps easily.
        </p>

        <p><b>Requirements</b></p>
        <p>Let’s look at the requirements in detail, and I’ll point you to some helpful resources.</p>

        <dl>

        <dt><p>1. Object Oriented Programming</p></dt>
        <dd><p>
            Obviously, to create a desktop app using Python, you have to understand the basics of Python. Since we know the basics of Python already, I recommend you take a step forward to learn Object Oriented Programing. 
            Desktop apps work mostly based on objects, and hence, you need to know the object-oriented concepts in Python to create apps. 
            You should learn what classes, objects, methods, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, etc., are and how do they work.
            If you don’t know these things, don’t worry. I’ve written a complete guide on object-oriented concepts in Python. 
            But before going to that, let’s make your first desktop app, even if you don’t know anything.

        <dt><p>2. Learn the Tkinter Library</p></dt>
        <dd><p>
            Now to be able to create Desktop GUI Apps Using Tkinter, learn the basics of Tkinter

        </p>
        </dd>
        </dl><br><br>
    
        <h3>Mobile Apps</h3>
        <p>
            Once again, there are a lot of python mobile app frameworks but I will recommend Kivy since it simple and easy to learn. <br>
            Kivy was first released in early 2011. This cross-platform Python framework can be deployed to Windows, Mac, Linux, and Raspberry Pi. 
            It supports multitouch events in addition to regular keyboard and mouse inputs. Kivy even supports GPU acceleration of its graphics, since they’re built using OpenGL ES2. 
            The project uses the MIT license, so you can use this library for free and commercial software.
            <br><br>
            When you create an application with Kivy, you’re creating a Natural User Interface or NUI. 
            The idea behind a Natural User Interface is that the user can easily learn how to use your software with little to no instruction.
            <br><br>
            Kivy does not attempt to use native controls or widgets. All of its widgets are custom-drawn. This means that Kivy applications will look the same across all platforms. However, it also means that your app’s look and feel will differ from your user’s native applications. This could be a benefit or a drawback, depending on your audience.
